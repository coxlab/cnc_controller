update positions fails (possibly on atlasImage lock/unlock)
ap coordinates very off (underestimating ap)
reoptimize exposure for the camera
try and figure out a way to speed up the w-axis and camera capture
saving settings to controllers kills motors (do not save every time)
exposure that is good for registering cameras is bad for electrode tip
error in selection of tip could explain the tilts what about scaling?
I think most of it could be explained by error in identifying the tip
 - when I used one of the bonding points, the path looked ok
 - add way to delete single points in table
