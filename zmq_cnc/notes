command structure : <command> <argument>
if argument == ? : poll status
node : command : result
[x y z b w] : "p" : position
[x y z b w] : "m" : move (relative)/poll if moving
[x y z b w] : "s" : motor status
[x y z b w] : "v" : velocity
[x y z b w] : "e" : e-stop (stop axis)
[all]       : "j" : joystick
[all]       : "r" : point rotation
[all]       : "t" : tip position


--Bare minimum required--
  axis positions
  moving?
  move relative
  set velocity
  enable/disable motion
  stop motion
  enable/disable joystick
  point rotation
  calculate tip position
  
===================================
movement can be performed all within the module?
-- This prevents things like the frame manager from issuing commands in skull coordinates

configuration can be all within the module?
-- seems sensible although the joystick might be useful (not so much any more?)

path measurement needs axis position status

This seems like I'm taking a complicated thing (newport serial protocol), simplifying it (python class), then complicating it again (zeromq).
Is there a simpler solution?
