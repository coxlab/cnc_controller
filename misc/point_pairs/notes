the majority of the data is in point pairs acquired form the stereo cameras
a data structure like the following should suffice

class 2dPoint:
    srcImage = pointer or file path to image
    x = 0 is left
    y = 0 is top?

class 3dPoint:
    frame = [Skull/TC/Camera]
    x = - is ?
    y = - is ?
    z = - is ?

class PointPair(3dPoint):
    left = 2dPoint for 'left' source
    right = 2dPoint for 'right' source

class FrameManager:
    """ manages translation between frames """


--------------------

Maybe I want a wrapper around frame manager that is a frame constructor


Frame Camera
Frame TC
Frame Skull
Stack (frames are ordered as a list for a right now) [Camera <-> TC <-> Skull]
