trying to keep some semblence of path across point rotations
I need to know:
 - plane of rotation in some sort of frame
 - distance of point rotation (offset compensated arm length)
 - angle or rotation

I don't yet have the plane of rotation. steps to get it
 - map cnc frame (axes are homed, etc..)
 - just map plane of rotation (I have the points, may be simpler)

-- measuring cnc frame --
I need several points in camera and cnc frames where each axis moves

procedure will be:

calculate point (tip) in cnc frame (accounting for rotation)
map point to camera frame (rigid transform, not accounting for rotation)

problem: rotation axis may not be aligned with x-axis
fine z may not be aligned with ?
