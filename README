Rewrite of cnc controller to:

* not depend on pyobjc
* be cross platform? (maybe just linux, mac osx)
* easier testing
* easier extensibility
* streamlined loading/configuration/logging
* fault-tolerant conduit/cnc/cameras/io
* seperate head/client (zmq?)


I want the UI to be seperate from the core and control as little as possible
