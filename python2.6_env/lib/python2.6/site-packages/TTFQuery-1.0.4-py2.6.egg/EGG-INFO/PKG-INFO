Description: FontTools-based package for querying system fonts
        
        TTFQuery builds on the FontTools package to allow the Python programmer to accomplish a number of tasks:
        
        * query the system to find installed fonts
        * retrieve metadata about any TTF font file (even those not yet
        installed)
        o abstract family type
        o proper font name
        o glyph outlines
        * build simple metadata registries for run-time font matching
        
        With these functionalities, it is possible to readily
        create OpenGL solid-text rendering libraries which
        can accept abstract font-family names as font specifiers
        and deliver platform-specific TTF files to match those libraries.
        
        TTFQuery doesn't provide rendering services, but a sample
        implementation can be found in the OpenGLContext project, from
        which TTFQuery was refactored.
