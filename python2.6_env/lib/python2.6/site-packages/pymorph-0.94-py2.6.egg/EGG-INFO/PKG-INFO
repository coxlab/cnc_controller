Description: Image Morphology Toolbox
        
        The image morphology toolbox implements the basic binary and
        greyscale morphology operations, working with numpy arrays
        representing
        
        This is a pure Python package which is the companion package
        to the book "Hands-on Morphological Image Processing." It has been
        updated to work with numpy and the names and interfaces have been
        Pythonised.
        
        Includes basic operations such as
        - erode
        - dilate
        - open
        - tophat opening
        - watershed
        - ...

        Future Plans
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        When all functions have a corresponding unit test and the whole of the
        API documentation has been re-written into numpy rst format, I will release
        version 1.0.
        
        The package is actively maintained and any reported bug will be fixed fast.
        
        Currently there are *no known bugs* (although testing coverage is not complete).
